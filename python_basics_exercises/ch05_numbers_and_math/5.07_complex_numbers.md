Section 5.7 - Complex Numbers

Python is one of the few programming languages that provides built-in support for complex numbers. While
complex numbers don't often come up outside the domains of scientific computing and computer graphics,
Python's support for them is one of its strenghts. 

A complex number is a number with two distinct components: a real part and an imaginary part. 

To create a complex number in Python, you write the real part, then a plus sign, then the imginary part
with the letter j at the end:

>>> n = 1 + 2j

When you inspect the value of n, Python wraps the number in parentheses:

>>> n
(1 + 2j)

This convention helps eliminate any confusion that the displayed output may represent a string or a 
mathematical expression. 

Imaginary numbers come with two properties, .real and .imag, that return the real and imaginary
components of the number, respectively:

>>> n.real
1.0

>>> n.imag
2.0

Python returns both the real and imaginary components as floats, even though they were specified as integers.

Complex numbers also have a .conjugate() method that returns the complex conjugate of the number:

>>> n.conjugate()
(1 - 2j)

For any complex number, its conjugate is the complex number with the same real part and an imginary part that
is the same in absolute value but with the opposite sign.
